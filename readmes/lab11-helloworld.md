# Lab 11: Spring

* [Code Link](../src/main/java)

## Description
This lab was an introduction to the Spring Framework.  To build the project I used the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).  Then I created a controller class called: ```HelloWorldController```.  The purpose of this class is to route requests.

### Routes

* ```"/"``` The root route prints "hello" in order to test the initialization and app functionality.
* ```"/capitalize/{string to capitalize}"``` This route will take the string entered in the last part of the route as a parameter, and then capitalize it.
