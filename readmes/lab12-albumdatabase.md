# Lab 12: Create a Spring App with RESTful Routing

* [Code](../src/main/java)

In this lab I created an app that allows a user to enter in album information which gets entered into a database.  Upon visiting the page, and upon entering a new album, the list of albums in the database is rendered for the user.

## Route
* ```/albums```  Will render all albums from the database, and provide a form for the user to enter new albums.
